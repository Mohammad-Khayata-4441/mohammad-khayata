    "overview": "Experienced Front-End Developer | React.js, Vue.js | Scalable Enterprise Solutions\nI specialize in building enterprise-level web applications with deep expertise in React.js, Vue.js, and their ecosystems. My focus on software architecture and state management ensures scalable, maintainable, and high-performance solutions. With strong leadership and collaboration skills, I have guided teams in implementing best practices and efficient development workflows.\n My expertise extends to crafting high-quality animations and interactive UIs, delivering seamless user experiences. I excel in modular UI design, complex data handling, and multi-environment deployments, contributing to large-scale web applications, e-commerce platforms, and ERP systems.\n My journey in web development began during my studies at the Faculty of Informatics Engineering, where I built a strong foundation in programming, object-oriented design, algorithms, and data structures using C++ and Java. Recognizing the industry's shift towards web technologies, I transitioned to web development in 2019, mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. During the 2020 quarantine, I deepened my expertise by learning Vue.js, React, and Nuxt.js.\n Driven by curiosity and a passion for continuous learning, I stay up to date with emerging technologies and best practices. My ability to research and implement optimal solutions has been instrumental in my growth.\n As a team leader, I have successfully managed development teams on large-scale projects, including e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and educational applications. Additionally, my experience as a mentor and trainer has given me valuable insights into guiding junior developers and trainees, helping them navigate their learning journey effectively.\n My goal is to continuously evolve in the field of web development, contribute to the advancement of modern technologies, and play a role in shaping the future of web applications. I am particularly drawn to the logical and programming aspects of development rather than design, making me deeply focused on efficiency, optimization, and technical innovation.",
